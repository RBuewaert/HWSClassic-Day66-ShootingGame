"Itâ€™s time to put your skills to the test and make your own app, starting from a blank canvas.
This time your challenge is to make a shooting gallery game using SpriteKit: create three rows on the screen,
then have targets slide across from one side to the other. If the user taps a target, make it fade out and award them points."
